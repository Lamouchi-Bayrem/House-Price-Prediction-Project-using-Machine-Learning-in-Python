# House-Price-Prediction-Project-using-Machine-Learning-in-Python
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting house prices based on various influential factors. By leveraging historical housing data, the model will learn the relationships between these features and house prices, enabling it to estimate prices for new  houses.
